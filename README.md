JP+ Maglevs is a NewGRF concept for [OpenTTD](https://www.openttd.org/), bringing Japanese Maglevs to the game. This set is complimented by [JP+ Multiple Units](https://github.com/Tintinfan/JPplusSet), [JP+ Engines & Wagons](https://github.com/EmperorJake/JPengines), [JP+ Shinkansen](https://github.com/KeepinItRail/JPplusShinkansen) and  [JP+ Metro](https://github.com/Yozora3/JPplusMetro) - with ever more JP+ on the way!

Actual implementation of features into this NewGRF as opposed to any of the other JP+ NewGRFs cannot be guaranteed.
